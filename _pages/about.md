# 👋 Biography

I am currently a researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, specializing in data analytics and deep learning-based condition monitoring of complex electro-mechanical systems. My work primarily focuses on fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis. I have authored over 50 publications in leading international journals and conferences, including Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing (MSSP), Reliability Engineering & System Safety (RESS), IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (TIM), and the World Congress on Condition Monitoring (WCCM). The impact of my research is reflected in its growing citation metrics on Google Scholar (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4D0W50YAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_Scholar-4285F4?logo=googlescholar&style=flat-square&labelColor=fff" alt="Google Scholar Badge"></a>).

I actively contribute to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for numerous prestigious journals (e.g., MSSP, RESS, and various IEEE Transactions) and as a Guest Editor for special issues in journals such as Sensors and Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences. I have also chaired technical sessions at major international conferences, including the International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Beijing 2024), the International Conference on Equipment Intelligent Operation and Maintenance (ICEIOM 2025), and the 15th Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Bruges 2025). Additionally, I serve as a guest editor for several special issues in peer-reviewed journals: Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences (IF: 2.5), Sensors (IF: 3.4), and Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering (IF: 2.0).
