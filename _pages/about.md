<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Associate at the Reutlingen Research Institute (RRI) in Germany. My research specialization lies in data analytics and deep learning-based condition monitoring of complex electromechanical systems, with a primary focus on fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis, I have authored over 50 publications in leading international journals and conferences, including Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing (MSSP), Reliability Engineering & System Safety (RESS), IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (TIM), and the World Congress on Condition Monitoring (WCCM). This body of work has garnered 470+ citations on Google Scholar and an h-index of 11 (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4D0W50YAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_Scholar-470+-4285F4?logo=googlescholar&style=flat-square&labelColor=fff" alt="Google Scholar Badge"></a>).

I actively contribute to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for numerous prestigious journals (e.g., MSSP, RESS, and various IEEE Transactions) and as a Guest Editor for special issues in journals such as Sensors and Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences. I have also chaired technical sessions at major international conferences, including the International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Beijing, China, 2024), the International Conference on Equipment Intelligent Operation and Maintenance (ICEIOM2025), and the 15th Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Bruges, Belgium, 2025). Additionally, I serve as a guest editor for several special issues in peer-reviewed journals: Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences (Impact Factor: 2.5), Sensors (Impact Factor: 3.4), and Frontiers in Mechanical Engineering (Impact Factor: 2.0).
