<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Associate at the Reutlingen Research Institute (RRI) in Germany, specializing in data analytics and deep learning-based condition monitoring of complex electromechanical systems. I hold a Bachelor‘s degree in Mechatronics from Shanghai Maritime University, China (2012), and a Master’s degree in Mechatronics from Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany (2016). During my studies, I gained practical experience in intelligent monitoring of electro-hydraulic systems during my tenure at Bosch Rexroth. I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium (2024), with a research focus on health monitoring and predictive maintenance of rotating machinery, encompassing fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis.

My research has resulted in over 50 publications in leading international journals and conferences, including Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing (MSSP), Reliability Engineering & System Safety (RESS), IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (TIM), and the World Congress on Condition Monitoring (WCCM). This body of work has garnered 470+ Google Scholar citations and an h-index of 11 (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4D0W50YAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Google_Scholar-470+-4285F4?logo=googlescholar&style=flat-square&labelColor=fff" alt="Google Scholar Badge"></a>).

In recognition of my contributions, I have been honored with Best Paper Awards from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 2018 and the International Federation for the Promotion of Mechanism and Machine Science (IFToMM) in 2020. I actively contribute to the academic community by serving as a reviewer for numerous prestigious journals (e.g., MSSP, RESS, and various IEEE Transactions) and as a Guest Editor for special issues in journals such as Sensors and Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences. I have also chaired technical sessions at major international conferences, including the International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and the Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM).
